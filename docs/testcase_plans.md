# Test-case Plans

This is a rough list of planned test-cases, organized in areas. Feel free to
contribute to the list and also use the list to get idea(s) where test
implementation is needed. We plan to mark test-cases that are implemented
as such as in this document, so we can also get a sense of progress. (However,
there is not guarantee that the status is up-to-date.)
