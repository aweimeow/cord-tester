# Testing CORD

The _CORD Automated Tester Suite (CATS)_ is an extensible
end-to-end system test suite targeting CORD PODs. It is typically
deployed as one or more Docker containers, either on the CORD POD
or adjacent to the POD and interacts with the POD through the
PODs interfaces.

Its intended use includes:

* Regression testing for CORD related component development
* Acceptance testing of a deployed CORD POD
* Health-testing of an existing CORD POD (including non-service-impacting
  and possibly service-impacting tests)

The strength of the CATS will come from the collaboration of the whole CORD/ONOS
community, and as such we welcome contributions.
