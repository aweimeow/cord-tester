# Testing CORD

CORD Tester is an automation framework that has been built to test CORD platform.  Currently framework extends to test R-CORD platform.

Framework is developed in a modular fashion to support various components of CORD.  By being modular, not only end-end but individual functional tests could also be developed.
- Framework is also used to write tests for both CORD-in-a-Box and physical POD installations.
- API framework is used to write unit level tests and end-end XOS based tests
